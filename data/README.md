# Data for Applications

This component contains the data for running the different applications, such as published emissions factors for different activities.  Because the same data is shared, they are put into this common directory.

Currently, we are using the PostgreSQL database for the common data, so additional information for setting up and installing the common data is found in [postgres/](postgres/README.md)  There is also an 
[orbitdb/](orbitdb/README.md) directory containing code samples for using orbitdb, but it is not currently in use and kept for archival purposes for now.
